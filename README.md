## About

Ascendancy is a new crypto-currency developing on the faults that other crypto-currencies have experienced and adding features that are needed for a modern, quick and usable digital currency.  

Ascendancy will use a PoW (Proof-of-Work) Algorithm that will be available for all users running the client to adopt or "mine". This will keep the network running, Stop growth of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) devices which use lots of energy and provide a more greener and widely available currency whilst using your CPU to work out calculations.  

These calculations are the core of the network, This is what keeps the network running. Once a calculation or problem has been solved a block is generated and you the miner will receive a reward of digital currency, then we move onto the next block. This is exactly how Bitcoin works but using a different algorithm.  

As well as being its own currency, it will be a framework for entrepreneurs to create their own token based asset and there will be specific placement for this in the protocol transaction header.  

We will also be generating more initial coins than Bitcoin, So the currency can be widely used around the world and be able to keep a stable value.
